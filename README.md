## Overview

`wp profile` monitors key performance indicators of the WordPress execution process to help you quickly identify points of slowness.

Save hours diagnosing slow WordPress sites. Because you can easily run it on any server that supports WP-CLI, `wp profile` compliments Xdebug and New Relic by pointing you in the right direction for further debugging. Because it runs on the command line, using `wp profile` means you don't have to install a plugin and deal with the painful dashboard of a slow WordPress site. And, because it's a WP-CLI command, `wp profile` makes it easy to perfom hard tasks (e.g. [profiling a WP REST API response](https://danielbachhuber.com/tip/profile-wp-rest-api/)).

[Identify why WordPress is slow in just a few steps](https://danielbachhuber.com/tip/identify-wordpress-slowness/) with `wp profile`.

## Using

This package implements the following commands:

### wp profile stage

Profile each stage of the WordPress load process (bootstrap, main_query, template).

~~~
wp profile stage [<stage>] [--all] [--spotlight] [--url=<url>] [--fields=<fields>] [--format=<format>] [--order=<order>] [--orderby=<orderby>]
~~~

When WordPress handles a request from a browser, it’s essentially
executing as one long PHP script. `wp profile stage` breaks the script
into three stages:

* **bootstrap** is where WordPress is setting itself up, loading plugins
and the main theme, and firing the `init` hook.
* **main_query** is how WordPress transforms the request (e.g. `/2016/10/21/moms-birthday/`)
into the primary WP_Query.
* **template** is where WordPress determines which theme template to
render based on the main query, and renders it.

```
# `wp profile stage` gives an overview of each stage.
$ wp profile stage --fields=stage,time,cache_ratio
+------------+---------+-------------+
| stage      | time    | cache_ratio |
+------------+---------+-------------+
| bootstrap  | 0.7994s | 93.21%      |
| main_query | 0.0123s | 94.29%      |
| template   | 0.792s  | 91.23%      |
+------------+---------+-------------+
| total (3)  | 1.6037s | 92.91%      |
+------------+---------+-------------+

# Then, dive into hooks for each stage with `wp profile stage <stage>`
$ wp profile stage bootstrap --fields=hook,time,cache_ratio --spotlight
+--------------------------+---------+-------------+
| hook                     | time    | cache_ratio |
+--------------------------+---------+-------------+
| muplugins_loaded:before  | 0.2335s | 40%         |
| muplugins_loaded         | 0.0007s | 50%         |
| plugins_loaded:before    | 0.2792s | 77.63%      |
| plugins_loaded           | 0.1502s | 100%        |
| after_setup_theme:before | 0.068s  | 100%        |
| init                     | 0.2643s | 96.88%      |
| wp_loaded:after          | 0.0377s |             |
+--------------------------+---------+-------------+
| total (7)                | 1.0335s | 77.42%      |
+--------------------------+---------+-------------+

wp profile eval <php-code> [--hook[=<hook>]] [--fields=<fields>] [--format=<format>] [--order=<order>] [--orderby=<orderby>]
