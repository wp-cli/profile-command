`wp profile` monitors key performance indicators of the WordPress execution process to help you quickly identify points of slowness.

Save hours diagnosing slow WordPress sites. Because you can easily run it on any server that supports WP-CLI, `wp profile` compliments Xdebug and New Relic by pointing you in the right direction for further debugging. Because it runs on the command line, using `wp profile` means you don't have to install a plugin and deal with the painful dashboard of a slow WordPress site. And, because it's a WP-CLI command, `wp profile` makes it easy to perfom hard tasks (e.g. [profiling a WP REST API response](https://danielbachhuber.com/tip/profile-wp-rest-api/)).
